1) What is an Abundant Number:
An abundant number is a positive integer that has an excess or abundance of divisors when compared to the sum of its proper divisors. In simpler terms, the sum of the numbers that divide evenly into an abundant number (excluding the number itself) is greater than the number itself.

2) Def
Let \(n\) be a positive integer. If the sum of the proper divisors of \(n\) (excluding \(n\) itself) is greater than \(n\), then \(n\) is called an abundant number.

3) Uses: 
Abundant numbers are primarily of interest in number theory, a branch of mathematics. They don't have many direct practical applications. Studying abundant numbers helps mathematicians explore the properties and relationships between numbers.

4) Eg. :
Let's take the number 12 as an example.
- The divisors of 12 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6. The sum of these divisors is \(1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 = 16\).
- Since 16 is greater than 12, we say that 12 is an abundant number.

So, 12 is an abundant number because the sum of its proper divisors is greater than the number itself. Other examples of abundant numbers include 18, 20, and 24.
