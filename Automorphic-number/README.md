1) What is an Automorphic Number:
An automorphic number, also known as a circular number, is a special kind of number where the square of the number's digits, when placed at the end of the number, results in the original number. In simpler terms, when you square the number and the result appears at the end of the number, it is considered an automorphic number.

2) Def:
An automorphic number, say \(n\), is a number such that \(n^2\) has the same rightmost digits as \(n\). Mathematically, if \(n\) is an \(m\)-digit number, and \(n^2\) ends with the digits of \(n\), then \(n\) is an automorphic number.

3) Uses:
Automorphic numbers are mainly of mathematical interest and don't have many direct practical applications. They are studied for their intriguing mathematical properties. The concept of automorphic numbers is part of number theory, a branch of mathematics that explores the properties and relationships of numbers.

4) Eg, :
Let's take the number 25 as an example.
- Square of 25 is \(25^2 = 625\).
- If we look at the rightmost digits of the square, it matches the original number 25.

Therefore, 25 is an automorphic number because when you square it, the result (625) retains the rightmost digits of the original number (25). Other examples of automorphic numbers include 5 (since \(5^2 = 25\)), 76 (\(76^2 = 5776\)), and 376 (\(376^2 = 141376\)).
