# Valid Parentheses:

This repository contains a Python/Java/C++ implementation of a solution to the Valid Parentheses problem. This is a common algorithmic challenge that checks whether a given string containing parentheses is valid based on specific rules.
---
### Problem Statement
Given a string s containing characters (, ), {, }, [, and ], determine if the input string is valid. A string is considered valid if:

1. Open brackets are closed by the same type of brackets.
2. Open brackets are closed in the correct order.
---
### Complexity
- Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the string. Each character is processed once.
- Space Complexity: O(n) in the worst case when all characters are opening brackets.
