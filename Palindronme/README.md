## Introduction
This project implements a Palindrome Checker that determines whether a given string or number is a palindrome. A palindrome is a sequence of characters that reads the same backward as forward, ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization.

### Features:
- Checks for palindrome properties in strings and numbers.
- Handles case-insensitive inputs.
- Ignores spaces and special characters.
- Provides clear error handling for invalid inputs.

### Requirements
- Programming Language: [Python/JavaScript/other language used]
- Dependencies: [e.g., Python 3.x or a specific library if any]
